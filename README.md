## Installation

### For [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

#### npm

To publish the library as a [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/),
please follow the procedure in ["Publishing npm packages"](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/publishing-npm-packages).

Then install it via:

```shell
npm install screenshot_capture_api --save
```

#### git
#
If the library is hosted at a git repository, e.g.
https://github.com/GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID
then install it via:

```shell
    npm install GIT_USER_ID/GIT_REPO_ID --save
```

### For browser

The library also works in the browser environment via npm and [browserify](http://browserify.org/). After following
the above steps with Node.js and installing browserify with `npm install -g browserify`,
perform the following (assuming *main.js* is your entry file):

```shell
browserify main.js > bundle.js
```

Then include *bundle.js* in the HTML pages.

### Webpack Configuration

Using Webpack you may encounter the following error: "Module not found: Error:
Cannot resolve module", most certainly you should disable AMD loader. Add/merge
the following section to your webpack config:

```javascript
module: {
  rules: [
    {
      parser: {
        amd: false
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Getting Started

Please follow the [installation](#installation) instruction and execute the following JS code:

```javascript
var ScreenshotCaptureApi = require('screenshot_capture_api');

var api = new ScreenshotCaptureApi.ScreenshotApi()
var token = "token_example"; // {String} A valid token is needed to make paid API calls. Tokens can be managed from your account.

  'ttl': 789, // {Number} Number of seconds the capture file is cached by our CDN. An API request that is loaded through the cache does not count as a paid request. You can set a number of seconds from 0 seconds up to 2592000 seconds. This is a maximum of 30 days.
  'invalidate': true, // {Boolean} Force the API to invalidate the cache and capture a new screenshot. This call costs you additional money, because a call of a cache hit is not charged.

  'delay': 789, // {Number} The delay in milliseconds to wait after the page loads before taking the screenshot. This is in milliseconds. One second is 1000 milliseconds. From 0 milliseconds to a maximum of 10,000 milliseconds.

  'height': 1080, // {Number} The height, in pixels, of the browser viewport to use. Ignored if you set full to true.

  'scale': 1.0, // {Number} The scale factor of the device to use when taking the screenshot. For example, a scale factor of 2 produces a high-resolution screenshot suitable for viewing on Retina devices. The larger the scale factor, the larger the screenshot produced.
  'x': 0, // {Number} The starting point of a section screenshot on the X axis.
  'y': 0, // {Number} The starting point of a section screenshot on the Y axis.
